### Micro Expression Recognized using Improvised XGBoost Classifier
The primary outcome of this project is an improved XGBoost classifier for micro expression recognition. This model is trained using a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO). The model is expected to have a higher accuracy inrecognizing micro expressions compared to existing models.
